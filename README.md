filtering
==========

R code implementing filtering tools from Percival and Walden (1993). This is based on their LISP code, it uses FFTW and requires compiling. This is my current working version and there are hard coded path's in some of the R files that will have to be changed. 

I will have to migrate this to an appropriate R package currently it uses a Makefile. I build in on Linux, you can build it in Window or Mac using either Rtools or Fink if you set up fftw and set the path variables appropriately.
